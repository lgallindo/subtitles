00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:11,117
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,046
Well, hello.

3
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:19,093
In this video we're going to play with the
Android emulator and I'm

4
00:00:19,093 --> 00:00:23,030
going to show you, uh, some tips and tricks that we can do with it.

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,710
But, uh, first of all let's just have a bit of
fun. We've got two of them running,

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,104
so why don't we send a message from one to the other.

7
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:33,680
Ah, let's start, uh, messaging, on this emulator.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,160
Okay.

9
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:45,210
And, uh, we'll write a new message.
Okay, so to, who should we send it to?

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,170
Well, for this, we need to know the, uh, how to send it to

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,900
the other emulator, and the trick to know
is that, uh, we're going to

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,600
use this number up here in the title bar,
so you'll see that

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,520
we have the name of the emulator instance
but also this numberâthis 5554.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,800
In fact the

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,515
first emulator that you start will always
have the number

16
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,000
5554. Ah, the second emulator will have two more than that, so 5556.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
The third emulator h-if we had a third one
running, would be 5558, etcetera.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,610
You can have up to 16 emulators.

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,250
I've never run 16 at a time, but I'm sure
someone in this course will tr-will try to.

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,100
So, let's, uh, send a message

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:40,450
to 5554, and we will say, "Hi," okay, right,
"let me out

22
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,705
I'm an emulator," or something like that.
So we'll click the Send button.

23
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:50,930
Okay, so this number, this 5554, is a port
number.

24
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:55,300
Now what is a port?
Well, just like, uh, when you dock

25
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,110
a ship at a port, it's a way for us

26
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,655
to connect to, uh, programs which are
running on a computer.

27
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,230
Ah, okay, let's start this up.

28
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, look, we have a message.
There we go.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,760
So we have a message from 5556, the other
emulator.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,890
And we could respond to that, and, uh, so-and text message, uh, each emulator for free.

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,420
Uh, so, the next segment

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,090
I'm going to show you is that, uh, the emulator, in addition to supporting the, uh,

33
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,198
keep the hardware keypads over here, so,
here we are; we have some buttons like

34
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:38,350
the home menu, ect-the home, for example.

35
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,350
Um, we can also control, uh, whether the emulator is in landscape or portrait.

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,160
So, uh, let's do that.

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,155
So on a, this Mac I'm going to press
Ctrl and F11.

38
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:49,940
Ah-ha!

39
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,320
And it's flipped over, and it, uh, restarts the home screen, ah, in its, ah, landscape mode.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,150
Now, why is that useful?

41
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,490
Well, the answer is that, behind the
scenes, um, when a phone call

42
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,590
comes in or when the user flips the phone
over to its side, 

43
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,290
uh, the system does quite a bit of work and
your app may have to

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,620
do quite a bit of work as well.

45
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,490
Perhaps it has a different layout, uh, ah,
configuration.

46
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,620
And so being able to test it on the
emulator,

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,650
uh, is an important part of getting your app
ready for publishing.

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,260
Right, so we can flip it back.
Ah, ah, one surprise, uh, I had

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,960
was that, uh, you've got to release both the
Ctrl key and F-F11 for this to work.

50
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Uh, I'm holding down the Ctrl key

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,048
now and pressing it multiple times does
nothing.

52
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:44,040
It, it, it ignores the function key until
I let go of, uh, both the Ctrl key and F11.

53
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,120
So if you're wondering why it's not
working, why it

54
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,380
can't flip, make sure that you let go of
both.

55
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,020
Okay.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,980
Let's pop it back.

57
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,070
Now there are other keys as well, and I'll
show

58
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,900
you later on in this video the, the link
for that.

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,550
Uh, right now,

60
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,340
uh, let's, um, show you the secret, uh, the, uh, secret way into the emulator.

61
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,870
Um,and for that we are going to need to
connect to this, uh, port number, this 5556.

62
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,910
Uh, and then we can start talking to the
secret

63
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,370
interface, if you like of the, of the
emulator.

64
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,030
For this, uh, we'll use a, uh, an old tool called, uh, Telnet,

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,400
uh, which allows us to type commands directly, uh, and connect

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,566
to a particular port on a certain machine.
Right, so, on a Mac how do we do that?

67
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:36,845
Well, first of all we will start a terminal,
okay.

68
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:40,110
Ah, so this is our terminal instance.

69
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,450
And I can now type telnet, and connect to
somewhere.

70
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,920
For example, let's have some fun, let's
connect to the BBC.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,496
Hey, BBC,

72
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:56,250
bbc.co.uk.
And if I was a, uh, web browser

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,680
like Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer,
by default I would connect to port 80.

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,090
So let's connect to port 80 on that
machine.

75
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,340
So, I've now connected to a distant
machine over in the UK, and here's where I

76
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,974
would request a particular webpage, um, so I would, there we go.

77
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,900
Uh, I was not fast enough; let's try it again.

78
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,510
Uh, let's connect here and, type some
gibberish.

79
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,600
And I guess what the, the server, uh, the BBC server did not

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,450
like my, my, my gibberish and said, hah, I
do not understand.

81
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,940
So it, um, it responded with, "Hey 400, bad
request"

82
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,430
and sentâthe client sent a bad request and

83
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,540
closed the connection on us.

84
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,718
Um, so if we were a more polite, uh, web client, we would of

85
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:54,510
course, uh, would've sent the correct, uh, codes to request a particular, uh, web page,

86
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,970
and we would, and the server would have sent back information, or sent

87
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,750
back, uh, an image, or sent back the text of the web page.

88
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,730
Uh, right, now we've finished, uh, playing at the BBC;

89
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,590
Let's, uh, connect to the, ah, emulator.

90
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,460
For this we need to know where it is and
which port number.

91
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,360
Uh, so it, it's, uh, on the local host so, I do telnet space localhost and Port 80.

92
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,390
But wait, what if you are a Windows user,
ah, how do you get, ah, telnet?

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,753
Well for that you might start by googling, uh, How to start telnet on Windows.

94
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:34,730
And, uh, here's a web query I performed
earlier; here it is.

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,850
And you discover that on Windows 7 and
Windows 8, uh, you have to jump through

96
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,400
some hoops first to reinstall, uh, telnet.
It's no longer available by default.

97
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,670
And here's the steps you'll need to go
through.

98
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,850
You'll need to open the Control Panel,

99
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,570
ah, find Programs and Features, and, and then look for Windows Features,

100
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,300
ah, and then, fe-, inside Windows Features you'll find a checkbox for the Telnet Client.

101
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,410
So, clicking on that will af-, and then
clicking on OK, will re-install, ah, ah,

102
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,450
Telnet client for you.
Right, so now you've got telnet, um, what do

103
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,460
you need to do to start it? Um, I-, you
have a Start menu, uh, enter Cmd,

104
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,720
so this is, uh, Windows equivalent of me typing, uh, terminal

105
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,930
in my Mac. And once you're inside the, ah,
command

106
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:32,580
window, ah, you can type telnet.

107
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,300
Now these instructions suggest just you
simply press Enter, but, uh, rather than do

108
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,360
that, ah, you could actually, ah, specify the, uh, machine that you want

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,350
to connect to and the port number, as we did over

110
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,190
here.
So, we are going to connect now to, uh, it's, uh,

111
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,360
there we go, uh, local host port 80.

112
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,450
Right, so let's do this.

113
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:02,400
Um, but we don't want port 80.
We want a different port.

114
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,860
We want to connect to the emulator, so
let's connect to, uh,

115
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,810
either 5554, the first emulator instance,
or my second emulator instance 5556.

116
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,660
Here we go.
All right.

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,540
We are in.

118
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,310
We are connected.
I'm now talking to, uh, the emulator.

119
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,750
I'm talking to the Android console that's, uh, behind this emulator.

120
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:27,120
And, uh, very helpfully it provides a little help menu so

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,370
I can type help and get a list of
commands.

122
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:37,669
Uh, so one of the useful commands is, uh, I could, uh, send a text message, an SMS

123
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:44,336
message, so let's send an SMS message to, ah, this Android instance, and

124
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:51,960
we'll say this message is from, let's say,
787, and we'll say Hello Emulator.

125
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,460
Woops.

126
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,460
I didn't get the syntax right.
Well, we forgot to send,

127
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,540
ah, sms send,

128
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,690
and then we need to say who it's from, so
787 blah blah blah.

129
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,250
And we'll say, Hello!

130
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,750
Okay.

131
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,380
Back on this side we'll see at the top

132
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,760
here we get, a little message appeared at
the top.

133
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,770
And if I pull this down,
there it is,

134
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,790
I've got it there.

135
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,580
Okay, let's pull it down.
I've got my little hello message.

136
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:24,850
All

137
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,100
right

138
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,700
So now I could write and test apps that

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,830
respond to text messages and test them
inside the emulator.

140
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,790
Uh, I can also from, uh this con-, this, the console, ah, control what

141
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,300
the emulator thinks the battery level is
doing, so right now,

142
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,350
it thinks it's at 50%, and over here,
after that

143
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,670
message disappears, you'll see it's, uh,
showing that it's connected.

144
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,890
It's recharging, and it's

145
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,380
recharging from 50%.
So let's, um, change that.

146
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:01,560
Right, so I will do help power, and we can
do power change the capacity to say zero.

147
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,860
Ah, okay, and you'll see now in our little
window, absolute, oh, okay.

148
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,300
Message disappears that it's actually
recharging from zero.

149
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,050
Ah, so again, we could, uh, test our apps

150
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,350
easily which respond to power messages.

151
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,800
Another useful thing we can do here is to
change the window scale.

152
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,910
So if I do help window, we'll see that we
have one command called scale, so let's

153
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,790
make it a smaller window, say 0.5.
And we have a little window somewhere.

154
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,090
Where have you gone.
There.

155
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,910
Uh, you can try to make the scale, ah, larger.

156
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,220
In practice I've found this is, a, a, ,a, a easy way and fast way to crash

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,220
the emulator. Uh, and then one final thing which I've, uh, often

158
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,650
used is the, the avd command to
temporarily pause the execution.

159
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,850
So, um, in avd, you'll see there's a start and stop

160
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,140
command, so I can do avd stop, and this has

161
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:12,120
paused, uh, the emulator, so it's not going to respond to any events right now.

162
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,050
Uh, this is, uh, useful if I'm running my laptop without power, and

163
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,570
this cuts the amount of power used by the
emulator by about half.

164
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,890
It's still using some CPU power, even
though we've, we've asked it to stop.

165
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,310
Um, but it's a useful trick if you're, if
you're trying to

166
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,150
make your, your own actual laptop battery
run for as long as

167
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,110
possible and you don't want to quit the
emulator.

168
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,010
Okay, so let's, uh, start it again.

169
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,810
Okay, you'll also notice there's a
snapshot interface there

170
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:46,000
and you can use that to, uh, save snapshots and, uh, d-, list snapshots.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,180
Uh, this is a way so you can, ah, restart your emulater instance from

172
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,220
a particular known state, perhaps, uh, with a couple of applications already installed.

173
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,150
That kind of thing.

174
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,400
This is, this is kind

175
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,410
of fun.

176
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,280
Let's, uh, let's, uh, let's call our, our emulator. So, into

177
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,830
the gsm menu, discover that we can [laughs] call it.

178
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,826
So all right. Hey, well, we better give it

179
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:13,536
a number that we're calling from, so there
we go.

180
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,583
And. [pause]

181
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:21,530
Our phone, somebody's calling our
emulator.

182
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,010
Unfortunately the emulator doesn't, ah, fully support voice calls,

183
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,390
and we can't make real outgoing calls, but

184
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,830
again, this a way to be able to test our
apps that might respond to calls.

185
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,790
Also, Android will, um, pull the rug out from

186
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,050
underneath running applications when the
phone is running.

187
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,975
Ah, a lo-, a lot of behind the scenes works.

188
00:12:40,975 --> 00:12:45,810
Ah, a lot of behind the scenes functionality
happens that the user doesn't realize

189
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,540
where and

190
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,650
the Android operating system will
temporarily put an app

191
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,300
on ice, if you like, and then restore it
later,

192
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,580
um, just in the same way that on a stage, ah, the

193
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,480
actors might disappear during the interval
and then when we pull

194
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,950
back the curtain again all of the actors
are back in

195
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,770
places, and the scenery is back, and the
props are ready.

196
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,050
Ah, Android does the same thing with apps in
order

197
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,070
to manage the very limited resources that
a phone has.

198
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,720
Okay, so, uh, let, we'll cancel the call, um, right.

199
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,130
And we need to give it the number again,
6754321.

200
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,710
Ha, and we hung up on the emulator.

201
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,590
Okay, so that's it for now; you've watched
me play with the emulator.

202
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:33,570
Now it's time for you to, to learn how to
use these emulators, so, um, let's see.

203
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,250
I, go to Google Chrome.
I want to show you two things on

204
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,770
the, um, developer website.

205
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,150
Uh, first of all is, uh, where can I

206
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,190
find the instructions for the, the
keyboard shortcuts.

207
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,760
Uh, they're not immediately obvious.

208
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,990
They are actually just a, a little lower than
you might expect.

209
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,250
Here I am on the developer.android.com,
and, um, the

210
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,340
last section on the left, uh, left here is, um,
we've

211
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,980
gone down past Download, we've gone past Workflows, we're past Support

212
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,050
Library. Inside Tools Help, uh you'll find in
here the emulator.

213
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,100
And this lists the keyboard shortcuts, uh, that you can use.

214
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,910
And like I say, the most useful one I find
has been

215
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,060
the ability to swap between different

216
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,710
layout orientations, either the portrait
or landscape.

217
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,605
So, uh, make sure you practice that,
and also see if, uh, full screen,

218
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:32,026
Alt+Enter works on your system as well.

219
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:35,210
And finally, let's, uh, talk about the speed of the eliminator and what

220
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,490
you can do to speed it up on your system.

221
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,300
So, um, if you're lucky you will be able

222
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,642
to get the, uh, Intel accelerator technology
working for you.

223
00:14:46,642 --> 00:14:53,520
A word of caution though at this point. At this moment in time, uh, uh, Apple has just released a maverick,

224
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,620
and the current available version of the, ah, technology

225
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,570
accelerator, the accelerator technology
does not work well with Maverick.

226
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,440
Does not play well.

227
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,440
So, hopefully by the time you look at this, um, if you've

228
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,760
got Maverick installed, then the HAXM
technology will have been updated.

229
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,290
If you cannot use the HAXM technology then I encourage

230
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,220
you to play with both the arm emulator and
the

231
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,670
Intel, ah, emulator, to see one, which one is faster for you.

232
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,730
You may find, as I did, ah, that the latest

233
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,350
emulator is a little bit slower than the
earlier ones.

234
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,980
Um, so, if I just, ah, talk about timings for a
moment.

235
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay, where is my...

236
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,040
Here it is.

237
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,820
Okay. Ah, if I just talk about, uh, timings for a moment.

238
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,480
Uh, let's see what we've got.

239
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,420
Um, I, I tried with four different instances
here, so

240
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,610
we have the early versions of Android, the, uh, level 10.

241
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:59,400
Here we go, the API level 10, and I tried
starting up the emulator

242
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,960
in both the arm and Intel, and both of
these took, uh, 30 seconds.

243
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,070
So, a little bit slow, but once you've
started up you can keep uploading

244
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,760
new versions of your app to it and so that's, ah, not, not, not too terrible.

245
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,765
And as you saw, the emulator was, was, was, ah, useful.

246
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:23,040
On further, more modern operating system, ah,

247
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,790
ah, things are a little bit slow without the
accelerator, so the, the ARM one was, ah,

248
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,850
75 seconds. [pause]
The Intel

249
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,576
was 135

250
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:45,170
seconds.
And, very slow.

251
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,900
So almost, ah, unusable.
Um, so if you don't have, uh, accelerator

252
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,170
technology, you're going to, to find it an
extremely frustrating, ah, experience to try to

253
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,990
use the latest Intel, ah, ah, ah, emulator.

254
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,620
Right.

255
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:07,429
So let's see what happens if we, ah, do install the, the technology accelerator.

256
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,310
All right. So, that's, out of this.
Right, how do we do that?

257
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,680
Well, a reminder that we used the SDK
manager.

258
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,640
And, ah, this tool allows us to configure which compartments we have, ah, locally.

259
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,370
So let me, just look at the things I've
got installed.

260
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,840
And you'll see underneath the extras, ah, I

261
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,910
have the Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator or
HAXM.

262
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:38,850
This, um, only, ah, accelerates the Intel images, not the arm images.

263
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,810
And its revision is, ah, revision three, so if
you're looking at revisions four,

264
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,670
maybe that will be working, ah, well with, ah, Maverick.

265
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,810
Okay, so, l-let's go and have a look at
that.

266
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,140
We've downloaded it, we've installed it,
according to this, but

267
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,900
actually we haven't yet run it, so I need
to go

268
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:05,022
and look at the SDK here. So we go into
Extras and Intel,

269
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:11,120
and here is the hardware accelerated
execution manager.

270
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,630
And on a Mac, we have a disk image file.

271
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,490
Let's open this.

272
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,980
You'll have a similar file in Windows.
And, ah, notice that even though, ah,

273
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,636
Android thinks it's version 3, Intel calls
this, ah, version 1.0.6.

274
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:34,530
So let's open this and just run through
the installation procedure.

275
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,380
Ah, here's a surprise.

276
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,340
We have to make a choice about how much memory to give the acceleration.

277
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,040
Ah, my machine has eight gigabytes.

278
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,010
And, I need some of that obviously for

279
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,200
the operating system, some of that for
Eclipse.

280
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,290
Ah, I'm going to have to put aside some of it, ah,

281
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,490
every time I want to run these hardware
accelerated managers.

282
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,640
The total amount I'm going to put aside is

283
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,840
for all emulators that are running at any
one time.

284
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,270
Now normally I just have one emulator
running.

285
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,040
Ah, what I found is with a emulator the
Nexus 4 is that I

286
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,980
can ump down the actual amount of RAM I
give it, say, from

287
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,460
1900 to about 1500, ah, and then that

288
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,078
comfortably fits inside, um, the Intel limit
here

289
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:28,250
that I'm going to give the accelerator of
say about two gigabytes or 2048 megabytes.

290
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,150
Um, so this memory allocation, I mean I'm
choosing

291
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,740
to take away from the best of my system.

292
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,420
So you have to try and find a, strike a
balance, with,

293
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,240
with what memory have on, ah, your, your
laptop, or your, o-or your system

294
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,820
so  that you have enough memory to run Eclipse. And the, the, other tools.

295
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,260
Um, so ideally you have at least, uh, a four
gigabyte machine.

296
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,240
Right, so let's go with 2048.

297
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,410
If you, um, decide

298
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:02,426
to play with this value, all you need to
do is, uh, run this, um, installer

299
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:07,620
again.
And then you can, ah, change the, ah, the amount of

300
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,980
memory that you've given the accelerator.
Okay, so that's installing.

301
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,860
Ah, it's not going to take five minutes; it's
going to be quicker than that.

302
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,260
And, let's, um,

303
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,810
go back to here.

304
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,330
Right, I should mention how we, we, we, ah, close our emulators.

305
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,630
You could click the power button but that
doesn't actually, ah, stop them.

306
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,730
It's, ah, it's easier to turn them off,
just close them.

307
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,830
Okay, right, so how's the Installer doing?

308
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:45,748
Right, once this is installed, ah, we're going to try, ah, running one of the emulators

309
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:50,517
again just to see what kind of speed-up we get here.

310
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:52,537
Okay, I need clips.

311
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:56,056
And go to my Android Virtual Device
Manager.

312
00:20:56,056 --> 00:21:03,756
Ah, let's start the Intel at level 10. Launch. [pause] It's working

313
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:10,840
and the emulator is running in fast vert
mode, ah, so now

314
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:18,386
we should, ah, see an emulator that is, ah, fairly speedy.

315
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:25,131
Here we go. And, uh, uh, uh, almost a joy to, to, to develop one.

316
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:28,891
Okay, so that's, uh, everything we're going to say at this point. I'm

317
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:33,917
going to f-finally mention that you'll
probably run into an issue or two.

318
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,023
Ah, maybe these, uh, this video has become a little

319
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,360
bit out of date, etcetera,

320
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,890
so do be sure to check the, ah, Coursera
discussion groups.

321
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:45,300
And also if you have a specific problem, ah, try to find out

322
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,900
as much as you can about your system or
the error message,

323
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,630
and then become a detective.

324
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,770
Use Google, use discussion groups,
etcetera to perhaps try and

325
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,870
find someone that's had, run into a
similar problem as you,

326
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,970
and see how they solved it.
Right.

327
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,740
That's it for now. Uh, time for you to,

328
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,240
ah, play with your emulators and find out what works on your system.

329
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,430
Bye.
